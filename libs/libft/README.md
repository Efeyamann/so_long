# LIBFT

A custom C library that reimplements standard library functions and provides additional utility functions for C programming.
This project is part of the 42 curriculum and involves recreating essential C standard library functions (such as strlen, strcpy, malloc, etc.), along with additional useful functions to simplify development.
